# FloppyEmu Disk II Enclosure
This project contains OpenSCAD files, STL files and a KiCad PCB to create a FloppyEmu-DuoDisk Adapter for the [Big Mess of Wires - FloppyEmu](https://www.bigmessowires.com/floppy-emu/) - an SD-card based disk drive emulator for the Apple II computer.
The adapter allows to connect the FloppyEmu to the DuoDisk cable and switch each drive separately (select each of the two DuoDisk drives or each of the two emulated FloppyEmu drives).

This project also contains data for a 3D-printed housing for the DuoDisk - FloppyEmu DB-25 adapter.
